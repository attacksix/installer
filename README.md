=========

Created on a windows machine with ruby installed by "railsinstaller".

ocra gem is used to create an exe file from the ruby file.

win32-shortcut gem is used to create the shortcuts.

exe file is a rar self extracting zip

Not sure why the .bmp file is there.  It isn't in the archive, just the .ico file is.
